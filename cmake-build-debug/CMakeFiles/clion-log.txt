CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findio2d.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "io2d", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "io2d" with any of
  the following names:

    io2dConfig.cmake
    io2d-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "io2d" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "io2d_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "io2d"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
